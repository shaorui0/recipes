I feel that my resume lacks any 'challenges' that can be 'mined.' I hope you can help me create some 'challenges' based on my projects. The challenges Iâ€™m looking for generally touch upon underlying technologies, such as what technologies were used to solve specific problems. These problems can relate to performance, high traffic, high data processing, or other types of issues. They can also pertain to design-related challenges.
