    - How would you handle concurrent access to a map?
- **Slices:**
    - How do slices differ from arrays in Go?
    - Can you explain how slices are internally implemented and how that affects their usage?
    - What are some common slice operations, and how do you handle out-of-bounds errors?
- **Structs:**
    - How do you define and use structs in Go?
    - Can you explain the concept of embedding in Go structs and its use cases?

### 5. **Interface Usage**

- **Basics:**
    - What is an interface in Go, and how is it different from interfaces in other languages like Java or C#?
    - How do you implement and use interfaces in Go?
- **Empty Interface:**
    - What is the empty interface (`interface{}`) in Go, and how is it typically used?
    - How do you perform type assertions and type switches on an empty interface?
- **Interface Design:**
    - How do you design and use small, composable interfaces in Go?
    - Can you explain the concept of duck typing in Go with respect to interfaces?
    - What are the advantages and potential pitfalls of using interfaces in Go?

    - What is escape analysis, and how does it affect memory allocation in Go?

### 7. **Error Handling**

- **Idiomatic Error Handling:**
    - How is error handling typically done in Go?
    - What are the advantages and disadvantages of Go's error handling approach?
- **Custom Error Types:**
    - How do you create and use custom error types in Go?
    - How do you implement and handle error wrapping in Go 1.13+?
    
    ### 8. **Go Idioms and Best Practices**
    
- **Testing:**
    - How do you write and structure tests in Go?
    - What tools do you use for testing in Go (e.g., `testing`, `testify`)?

    - What are the best practices for managing dependencies in Go (e.g., Go modules)?

### 9. **Advanced Go Concepts**

- **Reflection:**
    - What is reflection in Go, and how can it be used? What are the downsides?
- **Panic and Recover:**
    - How do you handle panics in Go, and when should you use `recover`?
